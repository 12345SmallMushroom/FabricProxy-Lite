# FabricProxy-Lite

Same as [FabricProxy](https://github.com/OKTW-Network/FabricProxy) but only support velocity and using Fabric-API handle velocity packet.

This will have the better compatibility with other mods.

## Setup
* Download mod
* Start server to generate config
* Setting velocity `player-info-forwarding-mode` to `modern` and `forwarding-secret`
* Setting `secret` in `config/Fabric-Lite.toml` match velocity config
* Set server to **offline mode**
